NOTE 1: Creating RPM for MCR resulted in removing of the symbolic info from matlab
dynamic libraries  and removing java jars in resultign rpm. Workaround: build tar.gz file.
NOTE 2 : Resulting tar file is ~200MB, too large to put on git. 

		HOWTO create tar.gz

Download Matlab Compielr Runtime (MCR) from 
	http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr

Run installer and provide  location.
  ./MCRInstaller.bin -P bean421.installLocation="matlabCR" -silent

Create tar distro (VERSION in verison.mk)
   tar czvf matlabCR-$VERSION.tar.gz matlabCR
